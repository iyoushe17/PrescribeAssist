Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better.

Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting...

Aripiprazole,Schizophrenia,"""Abilify 20 mg.
I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.
Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. 
My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  
I don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.

Zoloft,Depression,"""I have been taking Zoloft for 10  years. I take 100 mg daily. I have found that all of my symptoms have diminished. In times real stress, I take an extra pill. All I can say is that none of the previous drugs I took helped me at all. I have depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. At age 59 I still react to anything that sounds like gunfire. I spent 33 years working for the government, 2 in the Army the rest in law enforcement. I have found that I have no issues to deal with. I did once while out of the country lose my prescription while backpacking. It was horrible for me and my two friends. I take my pill in the evening before bed. No side effects at all. I found Zoloft to be a God send for me.""",10.0,179,40,i take zoloft year i mg daili i found symptom diminish in time real stress i extra pill all i say none previou drug i took help i depress post traumat stress disord at age i still react anyth sound like gunfir i spent year work govern armi rest law enforc i found i issu deal i countri lose prescript backpack it horribl two friend i pill even bed no side effect i found zoloft god send

Doxycycline,Rosacea,"""I developed Rosacea when I was pregnant with my first child (at age 39).  I never had skin issues before, even as a teenager.  I finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Papulopustular Rosacea (acne plus redness).  My doctor prescribed Monodox and it has worked WONDERS!  Within a week, almost all the pimples/bumps were gone. GONE!  I only hope that once I finish up the medication (60 days), it won&#039;t all come back.  The downside is the cost.  Thankfully, my doctor gave me a discount card from the manufacturer that allows me to buy it for $10 per month.  Otherwise, it was $225 for 60 day supply.""",10.0,28,109,i develop rosacea i pregnant first child age i never skin issu even teenag i final went doctor diagnos papulopustular rosacea acn plu red my doctor prescrib monodox work wonder within week almost pimpl bump gone gone i hope i finish medic day back the downsid cost thank doctor gave discount card manufactur allow buy month otherwis day suppli
Avonex,Multiple Sclerosis,"""I have been an MS patient since I was 17, I am 29 now, I have been using Avonex for 10 years now and am so happy with the results.  I take it before I go to bed at night on a weekend, I also take a couple of Tylenol with codeine (#1) and usually only have a slight headache when I wake up in the morning.  I do get a lot of migraines, but who knows if that has anything to do with the medication or the fact that I have Multiple Sclerosis.  Avonex has worked wonders for me, I usually only have an MS attack on average every 3 to 4 years and they aren&#039;t usually that severe.  I have relapsing and remitting MS.  I would recommend Avonex to anyone who is newly diagnosed.  It has changed my life.""",8.0,30,83,i ms patient sinc i i i use avonex year happi result i i go bed night weekend i coupl tylenol codein usual slight headach i wake morn i get lot migrain know anyth medic fact i multipl sclerosi avonex work wonder i usual ms attack averag everi year usual sever i relaps remit ms i would recommend avonex anyon newli diagnos it chang life
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had the Skyla placed a month ago. My Doc said I would experience some slight cramping during insertion and light cramps throughout the evening. I haven&#039;t had children &amp; have a tilted uterus; 2 odds against my favor. The doctor clamped my uterus, pulled it straight to allow for placement, &amp; manually dilated my cervix with another tool. The pain was excruciating. I was so miserable that I was holding my breath (accidentally) &amp; nearly passed out. She told me to take Ibuprofen for pain. After bawling my eyes out 45 mins driving home, I took Ibuprofen, but no help. I called the MD back and she said this was &quot;okay&quot; since I had a tilted uterus and never had children (bad answer). Now it&#039;s been in for a month &amp; cramps are rare &amp; tolerable.""",4.0,6,23,i skyla place month ago my doc said i would experi slight cramp insert light cramp throughout even i children amp tilt uteru odd favor the doctor clamp uteru pull straight allow placement amp manual dilat cervix anoth tool the pain excruci i miser i hold breath accident amp nearli pass she told ibuprofen pain after bawl eye min drive home i took ibuprofen help i call md back said quot okay quot sinc i tilt uteru never children bad answer now month amp cramp rare amp toler
